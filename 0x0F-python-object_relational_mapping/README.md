#--Object Relational Mapping --#

In object relational mapping we are linking the funcitions of Python with those of a Database Management System (DBMS). The command used in DBMS are abstracted so that one need only to work with objects in python and whatever objects are created and need to be stored are stored in the database.

In this project we are using MySQLite and working within a python virtual environment.

MySQLAlchemy is the Object relational mapper we are using.
