Data structure:
 Lists - collection of items
	empty list variable type can be declared by l = []
	list var with items can be decalred f = [1, "lime", 123, "Nokia"]
 Tuples are similar to lists but are not mutable like lists
	canbe indexed though
	To declare an empty tuple brackets are used t = ()
	for a single-element tuple a a trailing comma has to be included
	t = 12,
	tuple_r = "char",
	tuple_a = 1, 23
